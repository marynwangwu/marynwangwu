- 👋 **Hi, I’m Mary Nwangwu**

As a Master's in Data Science student, I have gained a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
I have completed coursework in programming languages such as Python, and have hands-on experience using data visualization tools such as Matplotlib. I have also completed several projects applying my skills to real-world data sets.
In my coursework, I have worked on projects involving predictive modeling, time series, and unsupervised learning techniques.
I am constantly seeking out opportunities to learn and grow as a data scientist, and am excited to bring my skills and expertise to new challenges!
